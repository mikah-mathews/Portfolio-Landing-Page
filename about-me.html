                        <p>Hi! My name is Mikah Mathews. I am 19 years old, live in Seattle, and am learning how to code!</p>
                        <p>My Dad is a programmer so he was always trying to get me to go into tech, and I finally have.</p>
                        <p>I really like how with coding, with a few lines you can make brand new things that seemed to have sprung out of thin air.</p>
                        <p>In my free time I enjoy going on walks with my poodle, baking, making cold brew, and reading Jewish Literature.</p>
                        <p>Another fact about me is that I am Transgender. I use They/Them or He/Him pronouns. I had top surgery in Late November
                            2019 and have been on testosterone since late October of 2019.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the future I hope to be able to volunteer my tech skills to LGBTQ+ non-profits, as well as give hope to queer youth that things will get better.</p>
